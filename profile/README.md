### `Project title`
BonBon - The Netzero social network

### `Explain Like I'm Five (ELI5)` 
Every time you buy candy, you will receive a seed to grow a tree. You can take these seeds home and plant them, or give them to others.

### `Abstract`
Bonbon is a social platform aimed at promoting a carbon-neutral lifestyle for the younger generation. With the rise of electric vehicles, green smart homes, and eco-friendly materials, it is expected that this demographic will be the first to embrace these sustainable trends. Bonbon’s mobile application connects with users' Internet of Things (IoT) devices (such as electric vehicles, smart homes, personal transportation, and other items) to collect data and calculate the specific amount of carbon emissions reduced. This reduction is minted into carbon tokens on blockchain, allowing users to manage, trade, and share within the community. Organizations can also purchase and burn these carbon tokens as a means of incentivizing green transitions or offsetting their own carbon emissions.
  
### `1. Motivation`

The development of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain presents an opportunity to integrate technology in promoting a green lifestyle, which is increasingly embraced by younger generations. A social network that connects eco-conscious individuals can easily gain traction. According to Carbonfootprint, one person switching from a gasoline-powered motorbike to an electric vehicle can reduce CO2 emissions by 0.3 tons annually. With just 825,490 people making this change, it would be equivalent to planting 82,549 hectares of forest — the amount of new forest planted in Vietnam in 2022.

Our mission is to promote eco-friendly lifestyles and prioritize carbon-neutral products. By 2050, we aim to help 1 billion people transition to sustainable living and achieve global net-zero emissions

With a future-oriented vision, Bonbon aims to evolve beyond a consumer app into a tokenization infrastructure, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for carbon reduction and climate change mitigation. We achieve this by integrating advanced technologies to uphold core principles:

- `Trustless system & transparency`: Utilizing IOT, AI and Blockchain to create a fully transparent and immutable system. You can always trace the origin and lifecycle of each carbon unit, no matter how small.
- `Easy use and permissionless`: Simple to use for anyone, and a new type of social network designed for those who embrace a green and carbon-neutral lifestyle.
- `Open source software`: The entire source code of the project is open source, allowing contributions and development from anyone.
- `Community-driven`: Centered around the community and oriented towards its features. Operated by a nonprofit organization and functioning under a decentralized management model.

### `2. How BonBon works?` 

Bonbon is an infrastructure for tokenizing carbon credits from human lifestyles.

- `Data collection layer`: We utilize users' mobile phones to collect carbon data from electric vehicles, smart home devices, and transportation, directly from manufacturers via APIs or by scanning QR codes.
- `Tokenization layer`: Collected parameters from manufacturers are sent to a validator to calculate the reduced carbon amount. This unit is minted on blockchain as a carbon token and transferred to the user's wallet, ensuring transparency, immutability, and protection against data tampering..
- `Green social network`:
  - Each user will have a personal carbon-neutral profile that reflects their carbon offset lifestyle. As a social network, users can connect with friends, share their green practices, and gift carbon credits.
  - With a gamification design approach, we aim to foster habits and engage users towards a carbon-neutral lifestyle.
- `Carbon Exchange`:
  - An AMM DEX where users can sell carbon tokens for additional income or purchase them to offset their personal carbon footprint.
  - Micro-carbon transactions are supported, enabling trades without large volumes, representing a significant improvement over the current carbon market.
- `Liquidity`: The primary source of liquidity for the carbon token exchange.
  - Factories and companies can buy and retire carbon tokens as credits to meet government neutrality requirements.
  - Funds, green programs, and suppliers can purchase tokens to incentivize youth participation in adopting a green lifestyle.
